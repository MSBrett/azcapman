**Prerequisites:**
- Azure PowerShell module (`Install-Module -Name Az`)
- Authenticated Azure session (`Connect-AzAccount`)
- Cost Management Reader permissions on the billing scope
- Valid billing account ID or subscription ID

**Parameters:**
- `BillingScope` (required): Billing account, subscription, or resource group scope
  - Billing Account: `providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}`
  - Subscription: `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`
  - Resource Group: `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}`
- `LookBackPeriod`: Historical analysis period (Last7Days, Last30Days, Last60Days) - default: Last7Days
- `Term`: Savings plan term (P1Y for 1-year, P3Y for 3-year) - default: P3Y

# Find your billing scope first
Get-AzBillingAccount  # For billing account scope
Get-AzSubscription    # For subscription scope

# Basic usage with subscription scope

## About the API

This script uses the Azure Cost Management [Benefit Recommendations API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/benefit-recommendations) to provide **savings plan purchase recommendations**. 

The API analyzes your actual compute usage patterns and calculates optimal hourly commitment amounts that minimize total costs compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. 

Recommendations include detailed financial metrics: commitment amounts, projected savings percentages, coverage percentages, utilization rates, and potential overage/wastage costs. The raw JSON output provides full API response details, while formatted tables present actionable purchase recommendations.
