# Quota group onboarding guide for ISVs

This guide helps Independent Software Vendors implement Azure quota groups to manage capacity across customer subscriptions.

## About this guide

Use this guide if you're an ISV who needs to:
- Share compute quota across multiple Azure subscriptions
- Reallocate unused quota without filing support tickets
- Request quota increases at the group level instead of per subscription
- Reduce quota management overhead for IaaS compute resources

## Quick start

New to Azure quota groups? Follow this learning path:

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started.html)** - Learn about quota groups and assess benefits for your ISV
2. **[Implementation](implementation.html)** - Set up quota groups for your ISV solution
3. **[Operations & Support](operations-support.html)** - Manage quota groups in production
4. **[Tools & Scripts](tools-scripts.html)** - Automate quota management workflows

## Why quota groups for ISVs

- **Share quota efficiently** - Pool compute quota across customer subscriptions in your group
- **Self-service management** - Redistribute unused quota without Microsoft support tickets
- **Streamlined requests** - Submit quota increases at the group level, then allocate to subscriptions
- **Reduced overhead** - Fewer quota-related support requests and administrative tasks

> **Note**: Quota Groups only support IaaS compute resources and require Enterprise Agreement, Microsoft Customer Agreement, or Internal subscriptions.
